/**
 * Represents a local or remote object which can be used for IPC or which can itself be sent.
 *
 * This object has a refcount associated with it and will be deleted when its refcount reaches zero.
 * How methods interactive with this refcount is described below. When using this API, it is
 * intended for a client of a service to hold a strong reference to that service. This also means
 * that user data typically should hold a strong reference to a local AIBinder object. A remote
 * AIBinder object automatically holds a strong reference to the AIBinder object in the server's
 * process. A typically memory layout looks like this:
 *
 * Key:
 *   --->         Ownership/a strong reference
 *   ...>         A weak reference
 *
 *                         (process boundary)
 *                                 |
 * MyInterface ---> AIBinder_Weak  |  ProxyForMyInterface
 *      ^                .         |          |
 *      |                .         |          |
 *      |                v         |          v
 *   UserData  <---   AIBinder   <-|-      AIBinder
 *                                 |
 *
 * In this way, you'll notice that a proxy for the interface holds a strong reference to the
 * implementation and that in the server process, the AIBinder object which was sent can be resent
 * so that the same AIBinder object always represents the same object. This allows, for instance, an
 * implementation (usually a callback) to transfer all ownership to a remote process and
 * automatically be deleted when the remote process is done with it or dies. Other memory models are
 * possible, but this is the standard one.
 *
 * If the process containing an AIBinder dies, it is possible to be holding a strong reference to
 * an object which does not exist. In this case, transactions to this binder will return
 * STATUS_DEAD_OBJECT. See also AIBinder_linkToDeath, AIBinder_unlinkToDeath, and AIBinder_isAlive.
 *
 * Once an AIBinder is created, anywhere it is passed (remotely or locally), there is a 1-1
 * correspondence between the address of an AIBinder and the object it represents. This means that
 * when two AIBinder pointers point to the same address, they represent the same object (whether
 * that object is local or remote). This correspondance can be broken accidentally if AIBinder_new
 * is erronesouly called to create the same object multiple times.

/**
 * Gets the extension of a binder interface. This allows a downstream developer to add

 * No thread safety is required.
 *
 * For instance, imagine if we have this interface:
 *     interface IFoo { void doFoo(); }
 *
 * A). Historical option that has proven to be BAD! Only the original
 *     author of an interface should change an interface. If someone
 *     downstream wants additional functionality, they should not ever
 *     change the interface or use this method.
 *
 *    BAD TO DO:  interface IFoo {                       BAD TO DO
 *    BAD TO DO:      void doFoo();                      BAD TO DO
 *    BAD TO DO: +    void doBar(); // adding a method   BAD TO DO
 *    BAD TO DO:  }                                      BAD TO DO
 *
 * B). Option that this method enables.
 *     Leave the original interface unchanged (do not change IFoo!).
 *     Instead, create a new interface in a downstream package:
 *
 *         package com.<name>; // new functionality in a new package
 *         interface IBar { void doBar(); }
 *
 *     When registering the interface, add:
 *         std::shared_ptr<MyFoo> foo = new MyFoo; // class in AOSP codebase
 *         std::shared_ptr<MyBar> bar = new MyBar; // custom extension class
 *         SpAIBinder binder = foo->asBinder(); // target binder to extend
 *         ... = AIBinder_setExtension(binder.get(), bar->asBinder().get());
 *         ... = AServiceManager_addService(binder.get(), instanceName);
 *         // handle error
 *
 *         Do not use foo->asBinder().get() as the target binder argument to
 *         AIBinder_setExtensions because asBinder it creates a new binder
 *         object that will be destroyed after the function is called. The same
 *         binder object must be used for AIBinder_setExtension and
 *         AServiceManager_addService to register the service with an extension.
 *
 *     Then, clients of IFoo can get this extension:
 *         SpAIBinder binder = ...;
 *         std::shared_ptr<IFoo> foo = IFoo::fromBinder(binder); // handle if null
 *         SpAIBinder barBinder;
 *         ... = AIBinder_getExtension(barBinder.get());
 *         // handle error
 *         std::shared_ptr<IBar> bar = IBar::fromBinder(barBinder);
 *         // type is checked with AIBinder_associateClass
 *         // if bar is null, then there is no extension or a different
 *         // type of extension
